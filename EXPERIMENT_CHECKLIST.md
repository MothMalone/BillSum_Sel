Embedding-Based      0.8892          0.4234          ✅ Success

🏆 BEST PERFORMERS
================================================================
🥇 Best BERTScore F1:  Embedding-Based (0.8892)
🥇 Best ROUGE-Lsum:   Embedding-Based (0.4234)
```

### Detailed Analysis
```bash
python show_results.py --detailed
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Primary Metrics (Must Pass)
- [ ] **BERTScore F1 > 0.80** for all methods
- [ ] **ROUGE-Lsum > 0.25** for all methods  
- [ ] **Embedding-based > Length-based > Random** for both metrics
- [ ] **No CUDA OOM errors** during training or evaluation

### Secondary Indicators
- [ ] Training completes in under 40 minutes total
- [ ] GPU utilization 80-100% during training
- [ ] Results saved to `results/production/real_experiment_results.json`
- [ ] Sample predictions look reasonable

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Memory Issues
```bash
# Check GPU memory
nvidia-smi

# If OOM errors:
# 1. Restart Python: exit() and restart
# 2. Clear cache: torch.cuda.empty_cache()
# 3. Reduce batch size in script if needed
```

### BERTScore Issues
```bash
# If BERTScore fails to compute:
pip install --upgrade bert-score
python -c "from bert_score import score; print('BERTScore OK')"
```

### ROUGE Issues  
```bash
# If ROUGE-Lsum not available:
pip install --upgrade rouge-score evaluate
python -c "from rouge_score import rouge_scorer; print('ROUGE OK')"
```

### Dataset Loading Issues
```bash
# If BillSum fails to load:
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"  # Optional but recommended
python -c "from datasets import load_dataset; load_dataset('billsum', split='test[:5]')"
```

## 📁 Results Files

After successful completion:
- `results/production/real_experiment_results.json` - Complete results
- `results/production/random/` - Random selection model
- `results/production/length_based/` - Length-based selection model  
- `results/production/embedding_based/` - Embedding-based selection model

## 🔬 Key Technical Details

### Main Metrics Explained
- **BERTScore F1**: Uses pre-trained BERT to compute semantic similarity between generated and reference summaries. Range: 0-1, higher is better.
- **ROUGE-Lsum**: Measures overlap of longest common subsequences, optimized for summarization tasks. Range: 0-1, higher is better.

### Why These Metrics?
- **BERTScore**: Captures semantic similarity better than n-gram overlap
- **ROUGE-Lsum**: Standard summarization metric, handles multi-sentence summaries well
- Both correlate well with human judgment for summarization quality

### Memory Optimization
- 4-bit quantization with BitsAndBytesConfig
- LoRA rank 8 (98% parameter reduction)
- Gradient checkpointing
- Batch size 1 + gradient accumulation
- BF16 precision

## 📈 Expected Performance Targets

| Metric | Random | Length-Based | Embedding-Based |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| BERTScore F1 | 0.82-0.85 | 0.84-0.87 | 0.86-0.89 |
| ROUGE-Lsum | 0.25-0.35 | 0.30-0.40 | 0.35-0.45 |

## 🎉 Success Confirmation

Experiment is successful when:
1. All three methods train without errors
2. BERTScore and ROUGE-Lsum show clear progression: Embedding > Length > Random
3. Results file contains complete evaluation data
4. No memory-related crashes on 16GB GPU
